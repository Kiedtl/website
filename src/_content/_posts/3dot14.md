# void @ 3dot14

This machine currently runs Void Linux (musl) with a hacked up `dwm` as the
window manager. The terminal is good ol' `xterm`, with `loksh`* as the shell.

\* loksh: the OpenBSD `ksh` ported to Linux.

I use [paleta](https://github.com/dylanaraps/paleta) to apply my home-brewed*
colorschemes to all terminals on startup. Nearly everything is done from the
terminal, with the exception of my browsing, for which I use Firefox or
netsurf.

The fetch program is [rsfetch](https://github.com/rsfetch/rsfetch),
which I've contributed to in the past. It's not written in shell, but in Rust,
which makes it much faster than, say, Neofetch or even ufetch.

\* home-brewed... sort of. colorschemes are actually generated by `imagemagick`,
which I then edit to suit my taste.

The bar is polybar, with `ttyp0` as it's font. Since I don't care for icons,
no additional font is used. Less is more.

For Rust/C development, Neovim is used as the editor. Weechat is used for IRC
communication with most of the interface disabled -- ii/sic is just too
minimalistic for actual use.

Boot times are insanely fast -- less that 1 second on my laptop, 5 seconds average
for my Raspberry Pi Zero W. This is due to Void Linux using `runit` as it's init
system instead of `systemd`.

My dotfiles, BTW, all managed using `git`. When I first started making backups
of my dotfiles to GitHub, I didn't know about GNU Stow. Now that my dotfile size
is increasing it's becoming increasingly harder to properly manage them with `git`
alone. Eventually I'll have to switch to Stow, but for now, I'm not changing
anything.
