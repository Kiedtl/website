# An Ode to Code
```
I look at your screen, and what I see
    Does not bode well for me or thee,
Thousands of lines, scripted and slow,
    The wind of complexity now shall blow.
    
And on that wind, I see the Studio's rise,
    Followed closely by Emacs' sad demise;
With the wings of megabytes our systems shall fly,
    And the fires of Time shall our code to the disk space tie.

So write your code, and write it now.
    Write it quickly, as fast as a cow.
But write not much, lest it be a pain
    To write it again in the javascript reign.

In the next century, when the Internet reigns,
    The world inhabited by dummies, half insane,
My soul and spirit thou shalt overawe
  When I read your code, and behold, it is raw.
```
