# Windows @ COMPUTANT
My one and only Windows machine, `COMPUTANT`, is used solely for tasks where Linux cannot be used, like for debugging a Windows program or using M$FT Office.

Religious biases aside, I like to use PowerShell 6 (PSH Core) as my shell. I just stick with the venerable Windows Console for my terminal and use some utilities provided by [**@lukesampson**](https://github.com/lukesampson) to make `conhost` and PowerShell at least tolerable to look at. In particular, I use [concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg) for the solarized color scheme, and [pshazz](https://github.com/lukesampson/pshazz) for the `babun`-themed prompt.

I tend to use Edge for day-to-day tasks and Vivaldi for others. For word-processing, creating presentations, taking notes, writing spreadsheets, and checking my email, I use Microsoft Office. I use Spacemacs and Micro for code editing since I couldn't get Spacevim to work on Windows. I also use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) for easy non-admin package management on Windows.

One thing that bothers me on Windows is the high CPU && RAM/Disk usage compared to Linux. Look at these screenshots from of my computer just after startup and with one tab in Edge open:

(On Linux, my CPU usage was about 10-20% lower than Windows, with quite a few applications open including several instances of Vivaldi running. My RAM usage was also much lower.)

I used [TranslucentTB](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB) for the transparent taskbar. Although you can't see it, I also use [AltDrag](https://stefansundin.github.io/altdrag/) to move and resize windows with the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.

In addition to the usual PowerShell `pshazz` prompt, I also coded a quirky prompt that looks really nice. It's a pain to use, though :)
