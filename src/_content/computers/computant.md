# Windows @ COMPUTANT
My primary machine, which I named `COMPUTANT`, runs Windows 10, which is for some reason is the butt of all the jokes on [r/linuxmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/). Actually, I've always found Windows to be more functional, efficient, and easy-to-use than Linux has been or will be.

Religious biases aside, I like to use PowerShell 6 (PSH Core) as my shell. I just stick with the venerable Windows Console for my terminal and use some utilities provided by [**@lukesampson**](https://github.com/lukesampson) to make `conhost` and PowerShell at least tolerable to look at. In particular, I use [concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg) for the solarized coor scheme, and [pshazz](https://github.com/lukesampson/pshazz) for the `babun`-themed prompt.
