# Status update: 2020-05-12

Well, I'm back on DWM. AwesomeWM's Lua extensibility and ability to simply
run `pkill -1 awesome` to reload the configuration is a huge improvement
over DWM for me, but unfortunately it was extremely laggy on my RPi due to
it being based on XCB instead of Xlib. I don't want to be using Awesome on
my main laptop and DWM on my RPi, so I decided to stick with DWM on both
machines. I may write an Xresources patch for DWM, though, to ease my pain
:)

Oh, and I'm trying out Emacs! While I'm usually an outspoken, anti-Emacs FUD
spreader, after hearing (and trying out) Emacs' glorious `org-mode`,
and getting interested in `elisp` (and Lisp in general), I've decided to
force myself to use Emacs (with EVIL mode ofc, since raw Emacs was clearly
designed with centipede in mind) for a week or so and then contemplate a
full switch. I'm optimistic so far: Emacs' extensibility with (Neo)Vim's
interface should be a good match. I guess Spacemacs was right after all: the
best editor is not Emacs or Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!

```
    kiedtl as Spacemacs says
    kiedtl the best editor is not emacs or vim
    kiedtl the best editor is emacs and vim
emacslover uhg
         * emacslover pukes
```
