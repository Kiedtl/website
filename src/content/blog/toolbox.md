# Useful tools

A list of tools and programs that I find useful that I might update
once in a while.

### Operating systems
- Linux ;)
	- **Pro**: no forced updates.
	- **Pro**: no forcibly installed junkware (cOrTaNa, OneDrive, Candy Crush Saga)
	- **Pro**: much faster (boot times, IO, whatever metric you have)
	- *Con:* depending on what distro you are using, steeper learning curve than Windows
	or Linux.

### Distros
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
	- **Pro:** awesome `pacman` package manager
	- **Pro:** rolling release (you're always using the latest version!)
	- **Pro:** great community(?)
	- **Pro:** you get to say that yOu UsE aRcH bTw
	- *Con:* Arch uses `systemd`, and there's no way to change that.
	- *Con:* Arch uses `glibc`, and there's no way to change that.
	- *Con:* Arch uses GNU Coreutils, and it's difficult to change it to, say, Busybox.

- [KISS Linux](https://k1ss.org)
	- **Pro:** Ruggedly mnmlist mentality.
	- **Pro:** Easy to switch out system components with others, unlike Arch.
	- Pro: extremely simple package manager gives you a lot of control.
	- Pro: extremely simple package format.
	- <s>Con: package manager hasn't had quite enough time to mature, and doesn't have many features.</s>

- [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org)
	- **Pro:** Runs on many architectures.
	- **Pro:** Ability to choose between `glibc` and `musl`.
	- **Pro:** uses `runit`, not systemd.
	- *Con:* package manager isn't all that great, and gives you very
	  little control.
	- *Con:* package format is ridiculously complex.

- [CRUX Linux](https://crux.nu)
	- **Pro:** glorious package manager and package format. Both are extraordinarily simple to use
	  and hack.
	- **Pro:** extremely simple by default.
	- **Pro:** easy to setup you're own package repository (necessary, since like KISS, no
	  that many packages exist in the repos).
	- **Pro:** merely mentioning that you use CRUX moves you up in the world of (SFW) [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).
	- *Con:* sparse community. not that many people use it, sadly.
	- *Con:* **most** packages are missing proper footprint/md5sums.
 
### Window Managers
- [`dwm`](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
	- **Pro:** configuration is in the source. This is precisely what makes `dwm` so extensible:
	  the fact that the configuration is a part of the source means that you can call custom
	  C functions from your config and from X (like Xmonad).
	- **Pro:** dynamic. Don't like tiling? `dwm` has floating builtin.
	- *Con:* hard to patch for newer users. Many users (me included) found `dwm` hard to use
	  due to the fact that it ships with a minimal set of features, and patches must be applied
	  to use certain features (such as a scratchpad). I recommend using [Luke Smith's setup](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz)
	  as a starting point, and to build up from there. Optionally, you can use [Mitch Weaver's setup](https://github.com/mitchweaver/suckless),
	  or, better yet, [my setup :-\]](https://github.com/kiedtl/suckless).
	- *Con:* because the config is in the source, you have to recompile and restart your X session
	  for changes in the configuration to take effect. This isn't bad, unless you're fine-tuning your tiling gaps.
	- *Con:* default bar sucks. Don't argue with me, it sucks, it sucks horribly, and nothing will change that.
	- *Con:* Polybar doesn't work too well with it by default. Usually, you'll have to add `override-redirect = true` to
	  you're Polybar config. Sometimes it's worse.
- [`sowm`](https://github.com/dylanaraps/sowm)
	- **Pro**: very simple, so like dwm, it's easy to hack.
	- **Con**: no borders.
	- **Con**: no EWMH support.
	- **Con**: it's __*floating*__.

### Terminals
- [`alacritty`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)
	- **Pro:** GPU rendered, making it blazingly fast - provided, of course, you have a good GPU
	  in the first place.
	- *Con:* if you don't have a good GPU or if you are on a platform that doesn't support OpenGL,
	alacritty doesn't work.
	- *Con:* configuration is in YAML, which really sucks.

- `xterm`
	- **Pro:** it Just Worksâ„¢.
	- *Con:* huge, at about 65K lines of code. Compare to (unpatched) `st`, which is 5K loc.
	- *Con:* very slow, depending on what you're doing.
	- *Con:* configuration is in Xresources. Xresources sucks.

### misc
- `loksh`: an implementation of the Korn Shell that's way better than `bash`. `bash`: 1.1M, `loksh`: 241K
- `mksh`: like `loksh`, but with some extra features such as `HERESTRINGS`.
- [`ly`](https://github.com/cyglom/ly): a minimal console-based display manager that, as a bonus, has a cool DOOM animation.
- [`slock`](https://tools.suckless.org/slock): the simplest lockscreen that I know of.
- `scdoc`: A markup format that compiles to mandoc.
- [`lcharmap`](https://github.com/lptstr/lcharmap): a little utility like the Windows `charmap.exe` ported to Linux.
- [`rsfetch`](https://github.com/rsfetch/rsfetch): a blazingly fast (<5ms) fetch program.

### Programming languages
- `C`: yep, raw C is the still the best language on earth, contrary to the opinion of some jAvAsCrIpT heretics.
- `Rust`: best described as a modern version of C++ obsessed with memory safety. Great when you're building something
that needs to be robust.
- `V`: I still don't have much experience with it yet, but when it matures, this is definitely one language I'm going to
  master.
- `PowerShell`: not quite a shell - more of an interpreted language often mistaken for a shell.

### fonts
- `ttyp0`: a better version of `misc-fixed`.
- [`cozette`](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette): a comfy font derived from Dina/proggy and heavily influenced by creep.
