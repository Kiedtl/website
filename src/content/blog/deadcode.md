# "keeping things fresh"

Dylan Araps, on his [website](blckk.me), states that he plans to eventually
make the switch from Openbox to another window manager. [^1] True to his
word, he switched to `bspwm` shortly after his Linux distro, KISS Linux, was
complete. [^2]

What's interesting to me, though, is his stated reason for switching:

> I would love to swap windows managers in the near future. Openbox
> has not seen an update or line of code in over 3 years and I
> like to keep things “fresh”...

Mmmm hmmm. Your switching from a stable, battle-tested window manager
not because it's configuration format sucks, or it's slow, or it's
bloated, but because it's old. [^3]

As if source code *rusted*.

[^2]: Having a severe case of NIHS, he eventually wrote his own WM, [sowm](https://github.com/dylanaraps/sowm).
[^3]: In case you didn't know, Openbox is slow, bloated, and has a terrible config format.
