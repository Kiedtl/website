# The Law of Conservation of Complexity

Normally, making an existing interface, (or program, library, whatever) simpler
is a good thing.

Sometimes, it isn't.

Because, at some point, making an interface any simple will simply move the
complexity somewhere else. The complexity will still be there, just in a
different place.

Often, this is due to a loss of flexibility -- the more simple something is,
the less flexible it will be.
